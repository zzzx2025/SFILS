# Performance Metrics

The performance of the app is stored in the logs folder which shows the history of our actions in the app. It includes the time and date, time it took to finish the action, and other things as well.

Putting the csv data into MySQL database took 50.406 seconds. If it took less than 20 seconds, that mean no data was actually loaded or it was missing data.
